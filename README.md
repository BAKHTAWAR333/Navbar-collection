This repository contains a curated collection of 13 professionally designed navigation bars.

Each navbar was created as an intentional UI exercise, focusing on layout precision,
spacing systems, typography hierarchy, responsive behavior, and refined interaction states.

Rather than relying on templates, every navigation bar was designed with
real-world production standards in mind, aiming for clarity, balance,
and long-term usability suitable for modern, scalable applications.
